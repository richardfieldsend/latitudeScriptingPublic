# latitudeScriptingPublic

A couple of years ago I rescued an old Dell laptop that one of the
research groups at my work was throwing out. It was old, big and
heavy, and wasn't really up to running Windows 7. I bit of tender
loving care, adding more memory and replacing the disc with an SSD
left me with a machine which was fine for running Linux. The result
was a perfectly good machine for less than Â£100.

The machine worked okay, a real workhorse. There was a slowly
worsening problem with the screen where the hinge on one side had
broken, but the other hinge was fine.

In the last week the hinge finally gave out and the screen was
floppy. I did manage to make a repair which held out for a week, but
that failed too, so now I am moving on.

I'm fortunate that I have now got my hands on another Dell Latitude,
and this one is a much better machine! One evening with a Linux Mint
installation USB stick and I'm back up and running. There are lots of
tweaks required, and it is a work in progress, but this repository is
for the various scripts that I need to make the most of this
machine.

A list of the scripts will be added as the scripts are created.

## Scripts:

* neotransplain: I recently purchased a Alphasmart Neo2
  (https://www.amazon.co.uk/Neo2-Alphasmart-Processor-Keyboard-Calculator/dp/B00T0ZG06O)
  I came across this device because I'd been interested in the
  distraction free writing systems, and while modern equivalents which
  can store documents in the cloud are expensive, items like the Neo2
  can be got on eBay for very reasonable amounts of money. The Neo2
  transfers files to a computer by behaving as an external
  keyboard. The script carries out a post-processing step on files
  that have been trasferred. See the comments in the file for more
  information.
